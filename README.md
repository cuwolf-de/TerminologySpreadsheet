TerminologySpreadsheet is a simple Web-Application for editing Spreadsheet-Tables with optional Terminology-Search Feature.

Feel free to try out our tool at [http://mosd.cuwolf.de](http://mosd.cuwolf.de)

Entering research data into spreadsheets with Excel or Libre Office is currently a common way. If others later on want to reuse these data they are very often facing the problem of not knowing exactly what the entered keywords in the cells describe exactly and need to contact the researcher for further information. To solve these problems there are currently some terminology-services like [gfbio](https://www.gfbio.org/) available. These services offer the ability to search for keywords in different terminology-databases for animal names, geo locations and so on. There one finds the standartized keywords and further information like Taxonomy and classification of e.g. an animal name.

This web-application offers an online spreadsheet editor with (optional) integrated search for terminologies and keywords. When exporting and saving your spreadsheet, you have the ability to not only save the terminology-text it self. You can also export the database source and further information of the searched terminology.
